<h1><i>WHAT'S HE DOING IN THERE?</i></h1>

<div class="bk1"><h2><small>By FRITZ LEIBER</small></h2>

<p><big><b><i>He went where no Martian ever
went before&mdash;but would he come
out&mdash;or had he gone for good?</i></b></big></p>

<p class="rgt"><big><b>Illustrated By BOWMAN</b></big></p></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> Professor was congratulating
Earth's first visitor
from another planet on
his wisdom in getting in touch with
a cultural anthropologist before
contacting any other scientists (or
governments, God forbid!), and in
learning English from radio and
TV before landing from his orbit-parked
rocket, when the Martian
stood up and said hesitantly, "Excuse
me, please, but where is it?"</p>

<p>That baffled the Professor and
the Martian seemed to grow
anxious&mdash;at least his long mouth
curved upward, and he had earlier
explained that it curling downward
was his smile&mdash;and he repeated,
"Please, where is it?"</p>

<p>He was surprisingly humanoid
in most respects, but his complexion
was textured so like the
rich dark armchair he'd just been
occupying that the Professor's pin-striped
gray suit, which he had
eagerly consented to wear, seemed
an arbitrary interruption between
him and the chair&mdash;a sort of
Mother Hubbard dress on a phantom
conjured from its leather.</p>

<p>The Professor's Wife, always a
perceptive hostess, came to her
husband's rescue by saying with
equal rapidity, "Top of the stairs,
end of the hall, last door."</p>

<p>The Martian's mouth curled
happily downward and he said,
"Thank you very much," and was
off.</p>

<p>Comprehension burst on the
Professor. He caught up with his
guest at the foot of the stairs.</p>

<p>"Here, I'll show you the way,"
he said.</p>

<p>"No, I can find it myself, thank
you," the Martian assured him.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Something</span> rather final in
the Martian's tone made the
Professor desist, and after watching
his visitor sway up the stairs
with an almost hypnotic softly
jogging movement, he rejoined his
wife in the study, saying wonderingly,
"Who'd have thought it, by
George! Function taboos as strict
as our own!"</p>

<p>"I'm glad some of your professional
visitors maintain 'em," his
wife said darkly.</p>

<p>"But this one's from Mars, darling,
and to find out he's&mdash;well,
similar in an aspect of his life is
as thrilling as the discovery that
water is burned hydrogen. When
I think of the day not far distant
when I'll put his entries in the
cross-cultural index ..."</p>

<p>He was still rhapsodizing when
the Professor's Little Son raced in.</p>

<p>"Pop, the Martian's gone to the
bathroom!"</p>

<p>"Hush, dear. Manners."</p>

<p>"Now it's perfectly natural, darling,
that the boy should notice
and be excited. Yes, Son, the Martian's
not so very different from
us."</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly," the Professor's
Wife said with a trace of bitterness.
"I don't imagine his turquoise
complexion will cause any comment
at all when you bring him to
a faculty reception. They'll just
figure he's had a hard night&mdash;and
that he got that baby-elephant
nose sniffing around for assistant
professorships."</p>

<p>"Really, darling! He probably
thinks of our noses as disagreeably
amputated and paralyzed."</p>

<p>"Well, anyway, Pop, he's in the
bathroom. I followed him when he
squiggled upstairs."</p>

<p>"Now, Son, you shouldn't have
done that. He's on a strange planet
and it might make him nervous if
he thought he was being spied on.
We must show him every courtesy.
By George, I can't wait to discuss
these things with Ackerly-Ramsbottom!
When I think of how
much more this encounter has to
give the anthropologist than even
the physicist or astronomer ..."</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/001.png" width="344" height="500" alt="" title="" /></div>

<p>He was still going strong on his
second rhapsody when he was interrupted
by another high-speed
entrance. It was the Professor's
Coltish Daughter.</p>

<p>"Mom, Pop, the Martian's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush, dear. We know."</p>

<p>The Professor's Coltish Daughter
regained her adolescent poise,
which was considerable. "Well, he's
still in there," she said. "I just
tried the door and it was locked."</p>

<p>"I'm glad it was!" the Professor
said while his wife added, "Yes,
you can't be sure what&mdash;" and
caught herself. "Really, dear, that
was very bad manners."</p>

<p>"I thought he'd come downstairs
long ago," her daughter explained.
"He's been in there an awfully
long time. It must have been a
half hour ago that I saw him gyre
and gimbal upstairs in that real
gone way he has, with Nosy here
following him." The Professor's
Coltish Daughter was currently
soaking up both jive and <i>Alice</i>.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">When</span> the Professor checked
his wristwatch, his expression
grew troubled. "By George, he is
taking his time! Though, of course,
we don't know how much time
Martians ... I wonder."</p>

<p>"I listened for a while, Pop,"
his son volunteered. "He was running
the water a lot."</p>

<p>"Running the water, eh? We
know Mars is a water-starved
planet. I suppose that in the presence
of unlimited water, he might
be seized by a kind of madness
and ... But he seemed so well
adjusted."</p>

<p>Then his wife spoke, voicing all
their thoughts. Her outlook on life
gave her a naturally sepulchral
voice.</p>

<p>"<i>What's he doing in there?</i>"</p>

<p>Twenty minutes and at least as
many fantastic suggestions later,
the Professor glanced again at his
watch and nerved himself for action.
Motioning his family aside,
he mounted the stairs and tiptoed
down the hall.</p>

<p>He paused only once to shake
his head and mutter under his
breath, "By George, I wish I had
Fenchurch or von Gottschalk here.
They're a shade better than I am
on intercultural contracts, especially
taboo-breakings and affronts ..."</p>

<p>His family followed him at a
short distance.</p>

<p>The Professor stopped in front
of the bathroom door. Everything
was quiet as death.</p>

<p>He listened for a minute and
then rapped measuredly, steadying
his hand by clutching its wrist with
the other. There was a faint splashing,
but no other sound.</p>

<p>Another minute passed. The
Professor rapped again. Now there
was no response at all. He very
gingerly tried the knob. The door
was still locked.</p>

<p>When they had retreated to the
stairs, it was the Professor's Wife
who once more voiced their
thoughts. This time her voice carried
overtones of supernatural horror.</p>

<p>"<i>What's he doing in there?</i>"</p>

<p>"He may be dead or dying," the
Professor's Coltish Daughter suggested
briskly. "Maybe we ought
to call the Fire Department, like
they did for old Mrs. Frisbee."</p>

<p>The Professor winced. "I'm
afraid you haven't visualized the
complications, dear," he said gently.
"No one but ourselves knows
that the Martian is on Earth, or
has even the slightest inkling that
interplanetary travel has been
achieved. Whatever we do, it will
have to be on our own. But to
break in on a creature engaged in&mdash;well,
we don't know what primal
private activity&mdash;is against all anthropological
practice. Still&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dying's a primal activity," his
daughter said crisply.</p>

<p>"So's ritual bathing before mass
murder," his wife added.</p>

<p>"Please! Still, as I was about to
say, we do have the moral duty to
succor him if, as you all too reasonably
suggest, he has been incapacitated
by a germ or virus or,
more likely, by some simple environmental
factor such as Earth's
greater gravity."</p>

<p>"Tell you what, Pop&mdash;I can look
in the bathroom window and see
what he's doing. All I have to do
is crawl out my bedroom window
and along the gutter a little ways.
It's safe as houses."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> Professor's question beginning
with, "Son, how do you
know&mdash;" died unuttered and he refused
to notice the words his
daughter was voicing silently at
her brother. He glanced at his
wife's sardonically composed face,
thought once more of the Fire Department
and of other and larger
and even more jealous&mdash;or would
it be skeptical?&mdash;government agencies,
and clutched at the straw offered
him.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, he was quite
unnecessarily assisting his son back
through the bedroom window.</p>

<p>"Gee, Pop, I couldn't see a sign
of him. That's why I took so long.
Hey, Pop, don't look so scared.
He's in there, sure enough. It's
just that the bathtub's under the
window and you have to get real
close up to see into it."</p>

<p>"The Martian's taking a bath?"</p>

<p>"Yep. Got it full up and just
the end of his little old schnozzle
sticking out. Your suit, Pop, was
hanging on the door."</p>

<p>The one word the Professor's
Wife spoke was like a death knell.</p>

<p>"<i>Drowned!</i>"</p>

<p>"No, Ma, I don't think so. His
schnozzle was opening and closing
regular like."</p>

<p>"Maybe he's a shape-changer,"
the Professor's Coltish Daughter
said in a burst of evil fantasy.
"Maybe he softens in water and
thins out after a while until he's
like an eel and then he'll go exploring
through the sewer pipes.
Wouldn't it be funny if he went
under the street and knocked on
the stopper from underneath and
crawled into the bathtub with
President Rexford, or Mrs. President
Rexford, or maybe right into
the middle of one of Janey
Rexford's Oh-I'm-so-sexy bubble
baths?"</p>

<p>"Please!" The Professor put his
hand to his eyebrows and kept
it there, cuddling the elbow in his
other hand.</p>

<p>"Well, have you thought of
something?" the Professor's Wife
asked him after a bit. "What are
you going to do?"</p>

<p>The Professor dropped his hand
and blinked his eyes hard and
took a deep breath.</p>

<p>"Telegraph Fenchurch and Ackerly-Ramsbottom
and then break
in," he said in a resigned voice,
into which, nevertheless, a note of
hope seemed also to have come.
"First, however, I'm going to wait
until morning."</p>

<p>And he sat down cross-legged in
the hall a few yards from the bathroom
door and folded his arms.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">So</span> the long vigil commenced.</p>

<p>The Professor's family shared
it and he offered no objection.
Other and sterner men, he told
himself, might claim to be able
successfully to order their children
to go to bed when there was a
Martian locked in the bathroom,
but he would like to see them
faced with the situation.</p>

<p>Finally dawn began to seep
from the bedrooms. When the bulb
in the hall had grown quite dim,
the Professor unfolded his arms.</p>

<p>Just then, there was a loud
splashing in the bathroom. The
Professor's family looked toward
the door. The splashing stopped
and they heard the Martian moving
around. Then the door opened
and the Martian appeared in the
Professor's gray pin-stripe suit. His
mouth curled sharply downward
in a broad alien smile as he saw
the Professor.</p>

<p>"Good morning!" the Martian
said happily. "I never slept better
in my life, even in my own little
wet bed back on Mars."</p>

<p>He looked around more closely
and his mouth straightened. "But
where did you all sleep?" he asked.
"Don't tell me you stayed dry all
night! You <i>didn't</i> give up your
only bed to me?"</p>

<p>His mouth curled upward in
misery. "Oh, dear," he said, "I'm
afraid I've made a mistake somehow.
Yet I don't understand how.
Before I studied you, I didn't
know what your sleeping habits
would be, but that question was
answered for me&mdash;in fact, it looked
so reassuringly homelike&mdash;when I
saw those brief TV scenes of your
females ready for sleep in their
little tubs. Of course, on Mars,
only the fortunate can always be
sure of sleeping wet, but here,
with your abundance of water, I
thought there would be wet beds
for all."</p>

<p>He paused. "It's true I had some
doubts last night, wondering if I'd
used the right words and all, but
then when you rapped 'Good night'
to me, I splashed the sentiment
back at you and went to sleep in
a wink. But I'm afraid that somewhere
I've blundered and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, dear chap," the Professor
managed to say. He had been
waving his hand in a gentle circle
for some time in token that he
wanted to interrupt. "Everything
is quite all right. It's true we
stayed up all night, but please
consider that as a watch&mdash;an honor
guard, by George!&mdash;which we kept
to indicate our esteem."</p>
